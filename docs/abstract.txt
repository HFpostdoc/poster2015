Background/Question/Methods
Community dynamics can lead to sudden or recalcitrant ecosystem state
changes, but our understanding of the general properties and our
ability to predict would benefit greatly from a model system that
permits both realistic models and manipulative studies. Here, we
further develop and apply a micro-ecosystem model based on the food
web of the pitcher forming carnivorous, Northern Pitcher Plant,
Sarracenia purpurea, to simulate oxygen production of how press
perturbations lead to ecosystem state changes.
Results/Conclusions
We found three main results:  1. The micro-ecosystem model reproduced
the gross behavior of the pitcher plant food web. 2. Sensitivity
analysis revealed several parameter combinations that lead to an
alternative state for oxygen production. 3. Furthermore, the parameter
combinations leading to the alternative state depended on the
difference in temporal scale of the photosynthesis and decomposition
rates. These results point to a general framework for identifying
potential ecosystem state changes. In particular, the identification
of interacting processes that may operate at different temporal scales
provides a predictive benchmark for alternate ecosystem states.
